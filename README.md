### Introduction
<p> This framework is built in flask and hosted by <a href="https://www.heroku.com"> Heroku </a>. There are two sites, a staging site and a production site.
<br>The url for the staging site is: http://venndordash-stage.herokuapp.com/
<br>The url for the production site is :http://venndordash-pro.herokuapp.com/
<br>We can change to custom domains at any point. </p>

### Todo:
<ul class="a">
<li> Change system configuration for staging site to have it only exist as development (no public access)</li>
<li>Add authentication to production site so only authorized venndor staff has access</li>
<li>Create API-get class to dynamically create and visualize venndor data</li>
<li>Integrate bokeh server and bokeh graphs to create interactive js-driven visualization</li>
</ul>
