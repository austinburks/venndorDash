# venndorDash

### Introduction
#### This framework is built in flask and hosted by Heroku. There is a staging and production server.
#### The url for the staging site is: http://venndordash-stage.herokuapp.com/
#### The url for the production site is :http://venndordash-pro.herokuapp.com/
#### We can change to custom domains at any point.

### Todo:
#### Change system configuration for staging site to have it only exist as development (no public access)
#### Add authentication to production site so only authorized venndor staff has access
#### Create API-get class to dynamically create and visualize venndor data
#### Integrate bokeh server and bokeh graphs to create interactive js-driven visualization
